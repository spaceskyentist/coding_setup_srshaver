3. Once the '.zip' file downloads, double-click it to extract and open the Visual Studio Code app.
4. Move VS Code to Applications folder: Drag it into your Applications folder for easy access.

## Step 2: Install Python
1. Go to the official Python website: [python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Click "Download Python 3.x.x" (the latest stable version).
3. Open the '.pkg' file once downloaded and go through the installer steps.
4. After installation, open Terminal (you can search for it via Spotlight), and type:

## Step 4: Set Python Interpreter in VS Code
1. Open a Python file (or create a new one with '.py' extension).
2. In the bottom-left corner, you‚Äôll see `Python x.x.x.` Click it.
3. Choose the interpreter that says something like:

   `/usr/local/bin/python3`
   
## Step 5: Run Python Code

2. Write:

    `print("Hello, world!")`

4. Yay! It works! (Celebration wiggle).
