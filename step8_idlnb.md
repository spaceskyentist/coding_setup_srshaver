# IDL Notebooks

## Step 1: Create your first IDL Notebook
1. Click IDL sidebar icon
2. Under "Notebooks" click: `New IDL Notebook`
3. Name your new notebook and save it in your project folder (e.g. 'first_notebook.idlnb`)
4. Now you can mix text and code like Python Notebooks!
5. You can execute different cells one at a time, or run all together.
6. ⚠️ Git on saving IDL Notebooks
   - IDL notebooks are JSON format
   - If using source control, graphics get embedded with source control.
   - **Don't save all of your graphics for source control** so they don't come along.
        - Click `Clear all Outputs` at the top of the IDL Notebook before saving your IDL Notebooks to Git/GitHub
7. If you want to share your Notebook code, you can share the Notebook itself, or output it to a PDF.
     - Click the PDF button at the top right corner
