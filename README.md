This repository contains a step-by-step guide to setting up coding software on your **Mac**. 

## Step 1: Download and Install VSCode
1. Go to the VS Code website: [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Click the "Download for Mac" button (make sure it says "Universal" or matches your chip, like Intel or Apple Silicon/M1/M2/M3
3. Once the '.zip' file downloads, double-click it to extract and open the Visual Studio Code app.
4. Move VS Code to Applications folder: Drag it into your Applications folder for easy access.

## Step 2: Install Python
1. Go to the official Python website: [python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Click "Download Python 3.x.x" (the latest stable version).
3. Open the '.pkg' file once downloaded and go through the installer steps.
4. After installation, open Terminal (you can search for it via Spotlight), and type:

  `python3 -- version`

You should see something like 'Python 3.12.3' (or whichever version you installed).

## Step 3: Add Python Extension in VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Click the **Extensions icon** on the sidebar (or press `⇧⌘X`).
3. In the search bar, type **Python** and install the official one from **Microsoft**
4. Once installed, it will help with syntax highlighting, linting, running Python files, etc.

## Step 4: Set Python Interpreter in VS Code
1. Open a Python file (or create a new one with '.py' extension).
2. In the bottom-left corner, you’ll see `Python x.x.x.` Click it.
3. Choose the interpreter that says something like:

   `/usr/local/bin/python3`
   
## Step 5: Run Python Code
1. Create a file like `hello.py`
2. Write:

  `print("Hello, world!")`

3. Right-click in the editor and choose "Run Python File in Terminal", or click the play button in the top-right.
4. Yay! It works! (Celebration wiggle).

## Step 6: Set up a Project and Virtual Environment (Recommended)
